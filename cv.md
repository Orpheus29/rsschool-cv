### Briefly About Myself:

In the 10th grade, I first got acquainted with a computer. I loved Math, so I fell in love in this flawlessly organized digital world. I went straight into it.

During school summer practice I wrote a computer program teaching the keyboard in a playful way. With the night sky, big letters flashing, several difficulty levels, etc.

My teacher liked what he saw and even promoted this product to one company that desired to acquire it. No jokes.

And, of course, there was my pet project named Batty. That was a game with the bat flying all over the screen, collecting diamonds and putting them in the holes in the bottom of the screen. More than 30 years passed, but I feel like Iâ€™m still in there.

Regretfully, there was no such profile as an IT worker back in 1991, so by advice of my father, military officer, I went to a military college and graduated as a journalist.

Now I am retired and full of hopes to make my old dream come true.

While in the military, I had a chance to lay out magazines. I loved it as much as my co-workers loved what I do, so today I'm choosing FrontEnd as a priority.

By this time, I have already completed several Internet courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

English was another of my favorite school subjects. Being in the military, I had the opportunity to improve my language skills serving for 2 years with foreign colleagues in the Coalition fighting the Global war on terrorism.
