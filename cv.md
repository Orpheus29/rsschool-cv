### Briefly About Myself:

In the 10th grade, I first got acquainted with a computer. I loved Math, so I fell in love in this flawlessly organized digital world immediately.

During school practice I wrote a computer program teaching the keyboard in a playful way. With the night sky, flashing big letters, several difficulty levels, etc.

My teacher liked what he saw and even promoted this product to a company that later wanted to buy it. No jokes.

And, of course, there was my pet project named 'Batty'. That was a simple game with the bat flying all over the screen collecting diamonds and placing them in the holes at the bottom of the screen. More than 30 years passed, but I feel like Iâ€™m still in there).

Unfortunately, back in those days there was no such profile as an IT specialist, so on the advice of my father, a military officer, I entered a military college and graduated as a journalist.

Now I am retired and full of hopes to make my old dream come true.

While in the military, I happened to lay out magazines. I loved it just as much as my co-workers loved what I do, so today I choose FrontEnd as my future profession.

By this time, I have already completed several Internet courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
